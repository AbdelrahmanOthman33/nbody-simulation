## Features
- **Newtonian Gravity**: Models gravitational force between bodies.
- **Multiple Integrators**: (e.g., Verlet, Runge-Kutta) for time-stepping.
- **Visualization**: Animate trajectories in 2D or 3D.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjust masses, initial positions, velocities, and time-step parameters.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
